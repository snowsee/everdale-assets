# Everdale Assets

A collection of assets present in Everdale, a game developed by Supercell.

Unlike other Supercell games, the assets folders in the game APKs are packed into `.osm` files. This repository only contains the unpacked folders. [You can follow these steps to unpack the files yourself.](gist)

Note that this repository does *not* contain the 3d files because of their massive size.

Some additional notes:

* The `.osm` files use dynamic `LZMA` compression and can be unpacked using [`everdale.bms`](evbms).
* The `_tex.sc` files use `LZMA` compression.
* The `.sc` files either use `LZMA` or `LZHAM` compression and can be decompressed using [`clash_royale.bms`](crbms).
* The `.csv` files are not compressed.
